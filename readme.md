Problem Statement:
The Asset Management Portal will streamline the tracking, management, and allocation of both physical and digital assets across an organization. Employees will be able to request and receive assets through an intuitive portal, while administrators can manage the entire asset lifecycle, from procurement to disposal. The portal will also automate asset assignment, ensure accurate record-keeping, and generate real-time reports on asset utilization and condition. Alerts will be triggered for maintenance or replacement needs, ensuring optimal asset performance and reducing downtime. By centralizing asset management, the platform will improve operational efficiency, reduce asset loss, and support informed decision-making.
